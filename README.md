# Lean4 Formalization Of Dialectica Constructions

This repository is a [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4) formalization of the theory of Dialectica Constructions, adapted from Sina's repo for Polynomial Functors. Polynomial functors categorify polynomials. Dialectica constructions add an extra layer of structure to polynomials, corresponding to propositions `over the polynomial'.

## Acknowledgment 
The work occurs during the Trimester Program "Prospects of Formal Mathematics" at the Hausdorff Institute (HIM) in Bonn. 

## Content (under development)
One difficulty is that Dialectica constructions don't look like polynomials at first sight. So the first goal is to prove an equivalence of categories.
